;;; Commentary:

;; To make the package useful it's needed to specify wildcard path
;; patterns to your project places. For example:
;;
;;     (setq find-project-patterns
;;           '("~/.emacs.d"
;;             "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/*"
;;             "~/projects/*"
;;             "~/work/*/*"))
;;
;; Once patterns are specified `M-x find-project' will present all the
;; projects matching the specified patterns. After project is selected
;; the default action (`dired') will be executed in the project's
;; root.
;;
;; Completion can be customized by specifying one of the completing
;; function (`completing-read' by default):
;;
;;     (setq find-project-completing-read-function 'ido-completing-read)
;;     (setq find-project-completing-read-function 'ivy-completing-read)
;;
;; Function executed after project is selected can be customized by
;; setting `find-projects-default-action' variable (`dired' by default):
;;
;;     (setq find-projects-default-action 'find-file)
;;
;;     ;; requires `find-file-in-repository' package
;;     (setq find-projects-default-action 'find-file-in-repository)
;;
;;     ;; requires `find-file-in-project' package
;;     (setq find-projects-default-action 'find-file-in-project)

;;; Commentary:

;; Before using the package you must specify patterns of your project
;; paths. For example:
;;
;;     (setq find-project-patterns
;;           '("~/.emacs.d"
;;             "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/*"
;;             "~/projects/*"
;;             "~/work/*/*"))
;;
;; Now if you call `M-x find-project' all matching projects will show
;; up. After you choose the project `find-project-default-action' will
;; be executed which is by default a list of pre-defined actions like
;; magit or dired.
;;
;; You can customize default action by specifying a list of actions:
;;
;;     (setq find-project-default-action '(find-file-in-repository find-file))
;;
;; Or a single action:
;;
;;     (setq find-project-default-action 'magit-status)
;;
;; in which case it will be executed immediately.
;;
;; You can customize completion functions for projects and actions
;; separately:
;;
;;     (setq find-project-completing-read-projects 'ivy-completing-read)
;;     (setq find-project-completing-read-actions 'ido-completing-read)
;;
;; Examples of valid completing functions are `completing-read',
;; `ido-completing-read', `helm-comp-read', `ivy-completing-read'.
;;
;; You can have more fine-grained control of where your projects are
;; located and what actions to execute by using the property list in
;; patterns:
;;
;;     (setq find-project-patterns
;;           '((:pattern "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/*" :action find-file)
;;             (:pattern "~/work/*/*" :exclude "~/work/*hat/*")))
;;
;; Valid properties are `:pattern', `:function', `:exclude' and
;; `:action'.
;;
;; `function' can be used when wildcards are not sufficient to find
;; your projects' locations.
;;
;; `:exclude' can be used for filtering out some directories. It can
;; be a wildcard, list of wildcards or a function accepting directory
;; as argument.
;;
;; In `find-project-patterns' you can mix both wildcards and plists.
;;
;; Global project filter can be provided via `find-project-exclude':
;;
;;     (setq find-project-exclude "*/.*")
;;
;; `find-project-exclude' can accept the same types as `:exclude'.
;;
;; By default, recently selected projects are suggested first. You can
;; disable this behavior by adding this line to your Emacs config:
;;
;;     (setq find-project-recent-first nil)

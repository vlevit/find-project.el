Before using the package you must specify patterns of your project
paths. For example:

    (setq find-project-patterns
          '("~/.emacs.d"
            "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/*"
            "~/projects/*"
            "~/work/*/*"))

Now if you call `M-x find-project` all matching projects will show
up. After you choose the project `find-project-default-action` will
be executed which is by default a list of pre-defined actions like
magit or dired.

You can customize default action by specifying a list of actions:

    (setq find-project-default-action '(find-file-in-repository find-file))

Or a single action:

    (setq find-project-default-action 'magit-status)

in which case it will be executed immediately.

You can customize completion functions for projects and actions
separately:

    (setq find-project-completing-read-projects 'ivy-completing-read)
    (setq find-project-completing-read-actions 'ido-completing-read)

Examples of valid completing functions are `completing-read`,
`ido-completing-read`, `helm-comp-read`, `ivy-completing-read`.

You can have more fine-grained control of where your projects are
located and what actions to execute by using the property list in
patterns:

    (setq find-project-patterns
          '((:pattern "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/*" :action find-file)
            (:function (find-project-traverse "~/projects/" 1 ".git") :action magit-status)
            (:pattern "~/work/*/*" :exclude "~/work/*hat/*")))

Valid properties are `:pattern`, `:function`, `:exclude` and
`:action`.

`:function` can be used when wildcards are not sufficient to find
your projects' locations. The value must be a function or a list
whose car is a function and cdr are arguments.

`:exclude` can be used for filtering out some directories. It can
be a wildcard, list of wildcards or a function accepting directory
as an argument.

In `find-project-patterns` you can mix both wildcards and plists.

Global project filter can be provided via `find-project-exclude`:

    (setq find-project-exclude "*/.*")

`find-project-exclude` can accept the same types as `:exclude`.

By default, recently selected projects are suggested first. You can
disable this behavior by adding this line to your Emacs config:

    (setq find-project-recent-first nil)

### Function Documentation


#### `(find-project-traverse DIRECTORY MAX-DEPTH &rest FILENAMES)`

Recursively traverse DIRECTORY up to level of MAX-DEPTH
returning list of directories containing at least one file from
FILENAMES. If MAX-DEPTH is nil it's considered that there is no
depth limit.

#### `(find-project)`
